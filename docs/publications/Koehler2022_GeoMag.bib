abstract = {The Franconian Platform of SE Germany and the underlying Permian and Triassic rocks that developed from latest Permian to Triassic time were affected by multiple compressional and extensional events that created a complex fracture, fault and stylolite network. We reconstructed the spatio-temporal variations of post-Triassic palaeostress fields in the Franconian Platform and Triassic strata using fault-slip and tectonic stylolite inversion. Our highly resolved stress inversion enables us to demonstrate a cyclic stress evolution from the stress regime of normal faulting to thrusting, strike-slip and back to normal faulting. Five main stress fields correlating with two stress cycles are determined for Late Jurassic to Cenozoic time. The first cycle consists of: (SF1) an initially NE–SW-directed horizontal extension during Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time; (SF2) NNE–SSW-directed horizontal compression with an early set of tectonic stylolites prior to the development of reverse and thrust faults; and (SF3) a strike-slip-dominated setting with (N)NE–(S)SW horizontal compression representing a first relaxation. The second cycle comprises (SF4) NW–SE-directed horizontal extension during Oligocene–Miocene time; and (SF5) a second strike-slip-dominated regime with WNW–ESE to NW–SE horizontal compression during the Alpine shortening, creating the youngest set of tectonic stylolites. In addition, we consider the transitional stages between thrusting and a strike-slip regime as a snapshot in the process of intraplate tectonics.},
