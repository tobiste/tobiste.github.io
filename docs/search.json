By analyzing such a vast compilation of zircon ages, we minimized potential biases arising from incomplete or limited datasets. This approach enhances the reliability of the provenance interpretations and their implications for understanding the tectonic history of the Peri-Gondwanan.\n\n\n\nDetrital zircon spectra of the sources for the sedimentary rocks of the Peri-Gondwanan shelf (Stephan et al., 2019, Fig. 3)."

This distribution matches that of sedimentary rocks covering the West African Craton.\nEast African–Arabian Zircon Province: Features a 1.8–2.0 Ga peak, a subordinate Eburnean peak, a modest 2.5–2.7 Ga peak, a significant ~1.0 Ga ‘Grenvillian’ peak, and a ~800 Ma peak, resembling sedimentary rocks from Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Iran.\n\n\n\n\nSpatial distribution of the pre-Variscan zircon provinces along the Variscan basement of Europe and North America (Stephan et al., 2019, Fig. 6)."

    "text": "Major implications\n\nTesting and Refining Paleogeographic Reconstructions: By identifying the source regions of sediments, the analysis allows for a reassessment of the paleogeographic positions of continental blocks. For instance, our study reveals that Iberia, previously believed to have a West African provenance, likely originated from an East African-Arabian source.\nIdentifying Ancient Oceanic Lithosphere: The absence of specific zircon age signatures can be used to infer the presence or absence of oceanic lithosphere between continental blocks. Our study found no evidence of additional oceanic lithosphere besides the Rheic Ocean, suggesting a vast and contiguous Peri-Gondwanan shelf.\nReconstructing Sediment Dispersal Patterns and Super-Fan Systems: Analyzing detrital zircon provenance helps to understand the pathways of ancient sediment transport and the existence of large-scale sediment dispersal systems. The identification of distinct zircon provinces led to the proposal of two independent super-fan systems, the West and East Gondwana super-fan systems, which supplied sediments to the northern Peri-Gondwanan shelf.\nUnderstanding Crustal Growth and Evolution: The distribution of zircon ages provides information about the timing and nature of magmatic and metamorphic events that contributed to the formation of continental crust. Our findings on the age distributions within each zircon province shed light on the crustal evolution of different regions within Peri-Gondwana.\nCorrelating Litho-Biostratigraphic Units and Terranes: Detrital zircon provenance analysis can aid in correlating rock units and terranes across vast distances, even when they are now separated by tectonic processes. Our study’s identification of similar zircon age patterns in geographically disparate regions supports the correlation of certain terranes and lithostratigraphic units."
