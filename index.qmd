I am an postdoctoral fellow and lecturer at the [Department of Geology at Lakehead University](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/programs/departments/geology) in Thunder Bay (Canada). I received a PhD in geology from Technische Universit채t Bergakademie Freiberg (Germany) in 2019.

My main research interest is the relationship between the deformation of rocks and the plate tectonic motion. To analyze these patterns from the micro-scale (thin sections) to large scale (tectonic plates), I use techniques from structural geology, metamorphic petrology, crystallographic preferred orientation, geophysics, geochemistry, geo-thermochronology, and provenance analysis. My research is based on field work, lab work, and computer modelling. 

I teach courses on structural geology, tectonics, and data science for geology.
