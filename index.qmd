My main research interest is the relationship between the deformation of rocks and the plate tectonic motion. To analyze these patterns from the micro-scale (thin sections) to large scale (tectonic plates), I use techniques from structural geology, metamorphic petrology, crystallographic preferred orientation, geophysics, geochemistry, geo-thermochronology, and provenance analysis. My research is based on field work, lab work, and computer modelling.
