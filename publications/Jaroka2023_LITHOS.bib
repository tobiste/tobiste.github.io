abstract = {The Lausitz Block, located in the northernmost part of the Bohemian Massif, hosts a large number of dike- to stock-shaped gabbroic intrusions that mainly comprise brown hornblende-poor (Group I; i.e. olivine gabbronorite, olivine gabbro, gabbro and diorite) and subordinately brown hornblende-rich lithologies (Group II; i.e. olivine-hornblende gabbro and hornblende gabbro). Several of these intrusions host small-scaled magmatic Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide accumulations. The intrusions are part of interconnected mafic–(ultramafic) plumbing systems that intruded Cadomian granodiorites of Lausitz Block in the Middle to Late Devonian during the early stages of the Variscan Orogeny. The previously inferred Devonian age of the intrusions is refined by biotite ArAr dating that yield ages between 389.1 ± 3.9 Ma and 372.2 ± 3.7 Ma (2$\sigma$). Group I and Group II lithologies differ in their mineralogical and geochemical composition. Compared to the Group I lithologies those of Group II are characterized by higher modal contents of primary brown hornblende, FeTi oxides and apatite, by Ti- and Al-enriched clinopyroxene and by lower contents of SiO2 and increased contents of TiO2, P2O5, LILE, HFSE and LREE. The differences suggest at least two different magmatic series where Group I rocks are linked to tholeiitic basaltic magmas with low to moderate Ti and volatile contents, whereas Group II rocks are derived from Ti- and volatile-enriched alkaline basaltic magmas. The magmas experienced clinopyroxene fractionation during their crustal ascent and storage, but were only minor affected by crustal contamination ({\textless} 5{\%}) according to Sr-Nd-Pb isotope systematics. The tholeiitic and alkaline basaltic magmatism could be explained by an intermediate tectonic environment between a subduction and intraplate setting. Group II rocks have an intraplate chemical signature and their parental magmas are clearly originated from a deeper-seated mantle source with melting of garnet peridotite, likely associated with an asthenospheric upwelling. By contrast, precursor magmas of Group I rocks are originated from partial melting of a less-enriched source, presumably spinel peridotite, from a subduction-related environment. Trace elements systematics suggest that both groups at least partly resulted from an interaction (mixing) of the alkaline and tholeiitic magmas. Partial melting estimates for both groups vary between 5 and 20{\%}. The proposed tectonic setting is might been related to a subduction slab retreat within the framework of the Variscan orogeny, which led to an upwelling of the asthenospheric mantle. Cu/Zr ratios {\textless}1 of gabbroic rocks from several intrusions suggest a previous segregation of magmatic sulfides in other sections of the magmatic plumbing system and give rise for a vertical and lateral NiCu exploration potential.},
