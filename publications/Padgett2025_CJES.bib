  abstract = {The Logan fault is one of many dextral faults that strike generally parallel to the NW-trend of the Northern Canadian Cordillera. Though widely documented, the timing and magnitude of displacement on many of these orogen-parallel faults are not well-constrained. Here, we present new low-temperature thermochronology data and thermal history models from the Upper Hyland River Valley area in the Logan Mountains in southeastern Yukon that document accelerated cooling between ca. 60–50 Ma in localized regions adjacent to faults that strike obliquely to and likely connect with the Logan fault. We propose that this phase of localized cooling was driven by the activation of a network of faults in the Upper Hyland River Valley, resulting in $\sim$4–5.5 km of local exhumation. We suggest that faulting in the Upper Hyland River Valley was synthetic with dextral slip on the Tintina fault, a lithospheric-scale structure thought to have accommodated $\sim$430 km of dextral strike-slip.},
