  abstract  = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The spatial analysis of horizontal stress orientation is important to study stress sources and understand tectonics and the deformation of the lithosphere. Additional to the stress sources, the geometry of stress fields depends on the underlying coordinate reference system, which causes spatial distortions that bias the analysis and interpretation of stresses. The bias can be avoided when the stress field is decomposed and transformed into the reference frame of its first-order stress source. We present a modified and extended theory based on the empirical link between the orientation of first-order stresses and the trajectories of lateral plate boundary forces. This link is applied to analyze the orientation of horizontal stresses, their patterns, and tectonic structures from the perspective of their first-order source or cause. By using only parameters for the relative motion between two neighboring plates, we model the first-order orientation of the maximum horizontal stress that statistically fits the orientation of {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}{\$}$\backslash$ge{\$}{\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} {\textless}math{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}≥{\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} {\textless}/alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} 80{\%} of the global stress data adjacent to plate boundaries. Considerable deviations of the observed stress from the predicted first-order stress direction can reveal the geometry of second-order stresses and confine areas where other stress sources dominate. The model's simple assumptions, independence from the sample size, potential application to regional to global scale analysis, and compatibility with other spatial interpolation algorithms make it a powerful method for analyzing stress fields. For immediate use, the presented method is implemented in the free and open-source software package , which is written in the computer language R. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract  = {The geodynamic activity of the NW-Bohemia / Vogtland region with its earthquake swarm activity is always studied in relation to the local emission of juvenile fluids, in particular of CO 2 . Based on a 3D interpretation of the geological setting, geophysical results, and new evaluation of existing data, our approach suggests a spatial separation of the upper crust into areas with differing pore fluids. The first area comprises a mixture of juvenile and meteoric pore fluids, where juvenile CO 2 diffuses towards the surface. The second area exclusively contains meteoric and no juvenile pore fluids. It is in this area where the earthquake swarm activity occurs. This separation provides an important constraint which influences shear processes as the contrasting fluid chemistry induces different interaction of wall rock with pore fluids. Long-lasting chemical degradation of the wall-rock with clay as a typical alteration product in crustal volumes with pervasive CO 2 discharge reduces the friction coefficients resulting in the weakening of the fault zone and allowing an aseismic slip according to the stress field. The presented studies suggest that the junction of two regional geological features of crustal scale, the N–S trending seismically active Leipzig-Regensburg-zone and the NW-SE trending fluid emission zone of magmatic volatiles, can be interpreted as a transition from frictional slip in the recent focal zones to aseismic behavior towards the southwest caused by clay coatings on the shear planes induced by a CO 2 containing pore fluid.},

  abstract  = {The Lausitz Block, located in the northernmost part of the Bohemian Massif, hosts a large number of dike- to stock-shaped gabbroic intrusions that mainly comprise brown hornblende-poor (Group I; i.e. olivine gabbronorite, olivine gabbro, gabbro and diorite) and subordinately brown hornblende-rich lithologies (Group II; i.e. olivine-hornblende gabbro and hornblende gabbro). Several of these intrusions host small-scaled magmatic Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide accumulations. The intrusions are part of interconnected mafic–(ultramafic) plumbing systems that intruded Cadomian granodiorites of Lausitz Block in the Middle to Late Devonian during the early stages of the Variscan Orogeny. The previously inferred Devonian age of the intrusions is refined by biotite ArAr dating that yield ages between 389.1 ± 3.9 Ma and 372.2 ± 3.7 Ma (2$\sigma$). Group I and Group II lithologies differ in their mineralogical and geochemical composition. Compared to the Group I lithologies those of Group II are characterized by higher modal contents of primary brown hornblende, FeTi oxides and apatite, by Ti- and Al-enriched clinopyroxene and by lower contents of SiO2 and increased contents of TiO2, P2O5, LILE, HFSE and LREE. The differences suggest at least two different magmatic series where Group I rocks are linked to tholeiitic basaltic magmas with low to moderate Ti and volatile contents, whereas Group II rocks are derived from Ti- and volatile-enriched alkaline basaltic magmas. The magmas experienced clinopyroxene fractionation during their crustal ascent and storage, but were only minor affected by crustal contamination ({\textless} 5{\%}) according to Sr-Nd-Pb isotope systematics. The tholeiitic and alkaline basaltic magmatism could be explained by an intermediate tectonic environment between a subduction and intraplate setting. Group II rocks have an intraplate chemical signature and their parental magmas are clearly originated from a deeper-seated mantle source with melting of garnet peridotite, likely associated with an asthenospheric upwelling. By contrast, precursor magmas of Group I rocks are originated from partial melting of a less-enriched source, presumably spinel peridotite, from a subduction-related environment. Trace elements systematics suggest that both groups at least partly resulted from an interaction (mixing) of the alkaline and tholeiitic magmas. Partial melting estimates for both groups vary between 5 and 20{\%}. The proposed tectonic setting is might been related to a subduction slab retreat within the framework of the Variscan orogeny, which led to an upwelling of the asthenospheric mantle. Cu/Zr ratios {\textless}1 of gabbroic rocks from several intrusions suggest a previous segregation of magmatic sulfides in other sections of the magmatic plumbing system and give rise for a vertical and lateral NiCu exploration potential.},

  abstract  = {The Franconian Platform of SE Germany and the underlying Permian and Triassic rocks that developed from latest Permian to Triassic time were affected by multiple compressional and extensional events that created a complex fracture, fault and stylolite network. We reconstructed the spatio-temporal variations of post-Triassic palaeostress fields in the Franconian Platform and Triassic strata using fault-slip and tectonic stylolite inversion. Our highly resolved stress inversion enables us to demonstrate a cyclic stress evolution from the stress regime of normal faulting to thrusting, strike-slip and back to normal faulting. Five main stress fields correlating with two stress cycles are determined for Late Jurassic to Cenozoic time. The first cycle consists of: (SF1) an initially NE–SW-directed horizontal extension during Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time; (SF2) NNE–SSW-directed horizontal compression with an early set of tectonic stylolites prior to the development of reverse and thrust faults; and (SF3) a strike-slip-dominated setting with (N)NE–(S)SW horizontal compression representing a first relaxation. The second cycle comprises (SF4) NW–SE-directed horizontal extension during Oligocene–Miocene time; and (SF5) a second strike-slip-dominated regime with WNW–ESE to NW–SE horizontal compression during the Alpine shortening, creating the youngest set of tectonic stylolites. In addition, we consider the transitional stages between thrusting and a strike-slip regime as a snapshot in the process of intraplate tectonics.},

  abstract  = {Three supercontinents have been suggested to have existed in the last 1 Gyr. The supercontinent status of Pangea and Rodinia is undisputed. In contrast, there is an ongoing controversy whether Pannotia existed at all. Here we test the hypothesis of a Pannotian supercontinent. Using first order tectonic constraints we reconstruct the Paleozoic kinematics of major continents relative to the East European Craton. Back-rotation from Pangea results in a supercontinent constellation in the early Paleozoic corroborating the existence of Pannotia. The presented model explains first order constraints for both the breakup of Pannotia and the subsequent assembly of Pangea. The breakup of Pannotia comprises (i) the early Paleozoic opening of Iapetus II and in turn the Rheic Ocean concomitant with the subduction of the Neo-Proterozoic Iapetus I Ocean, and (ii) the coeval opening of the Paleo-Arctic Ocean, that separated Siberia from the North American Craton. The subsequent convergence of the North American Craton, Avalonia, Gondwana, and Siberia with the East European Craton resulted in Paleozoic collisional orogenies at different plate boundary zones. The existence of Rodinia, Pannotia, and Pangea as pari passu supercontinents implicates two complete supercontinent cycles from Rodinia to Pannotia and from Pannotia to Pangea in the Neoproterozoic and the Paleozoic, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Early Ordovician to late Permian orogenies at different plate-boundary zones of western Pangea affected continental crust derived from the plates of North America (Laurentia), Europe (East European Craton including Baltica plus Arctida), and Gondwana. The diachronic orogenic processes comprised stages of intraoceanic subduction, formation and accretion of island arcs, and collision of several continents. Using established plate-tectonic models proposed for different regions and time spans, we provide for the first time a generic model that explains the tectonics of the entire Gondwana-Laurussia plate-boundary zone in a consistent way. We combined the plate kinematic model of the Pannotia-Pangea supercontinent cycle with geologic constraints from the different Paleozoic orogens. In terms of oceanic lithosphere, the Iapetus Ocean is subdivided into an older segment (I) and a younger (II) segment. Early Cambrian subduction of the Iapetus I and the Tornquist oceans at active plate boundaries of the East European Craton triggered the breakup of Pannotia, formation of Iapetus II, and the separation of Gondwana from Laurentia. Prolonged subduction of Iapetus I (ca. 530–430 Ma) culminated in the Scandian collision of the Greenland- Scandinavian Caledonides of Laurussia. Due to plate-tectonic reorganization at ca. 500 Ma, seafloor spreading of Iapetus II ceased, and the Rheic Ocean opened. This complex opening scenario included the transformation of passive continental margins into active ones and culminated in the Ordovician Taconic and Famatinian accretionary orogenies at the peri-Laurentian margin and at the South American edge of Gondwana, respectively. Rifting along the Avalonian-Cadomian belt of peri-Gondwana resulted in the separation of West Avalonian arc terranes and the East Avalonian continent. The vast African/Arabian shelf was affected by intracontinental extension and remained on the passive peri-Gondwana margin of the Rheic Ocean. The final assembly of western Pangea was characterized by the prolonged and diachronous closure of the Rheic Ocean (ca. 400–270 Ma). Continental collision started within the Variscan-Acadian segment of the Gondwana-Laurussia plate-boundary zone. Subsequent zipper-style suturing affected the Gondwanan Mauritanides and the conjugate Laurentian margin from north to south. In the Appalachians, previously accreted island-arc terranes were affected by Alleghanian thrusting. The foldand- thrust belts of southern Laurentia, i.e., the Ouachita-Marathon-Sonora orogenic system, evolved from the transformation of a vast continental shelf area into a collision zone. From a geodynamic point of view, an intrinsic feature of the model is that initial breakup of Pannotia, as well as the assembly of western Pangea, was facilitated by subduction and seafloor spreading at the leading and the trailing edges of the North American plate and Gondwana, respectively. Slab pull as the plate-driving force is sufficient to explain the entire Pannotia–western Pangea supercontinent cycle for the proposed scenario.},

  abstract  = {To be a quantitative and testable tectonic model, plate tectonics requires spherical geometry and spherical kinematics in terms of finite rotations conveniently parametrized by their angle and axis and described by unit quaternions. In treatises on “Plate Tectonics” infinitesimal, instantaneous, and finite rotations, absolute and relative rotations are said to be applied to model the motion of tectonic plates. Even though these terms are strictly defined in mathematics, they are often casually used in geosciences. Here, their definitions are recalled and clarified as well as the terms rotation, orientation, and location on the sphere. For instance, infinitesimal rotations refer to a mathematical limit, when the angle of rotation tends to zero. Their rules do not apply to finite rotations, no matter how small their finite angles of rotation are. Mathematical approaches applying appropriate and feasible assumptions to model spherical motion of tectonic plates over geological times of hundreds of millions of years are derived including (i) sequences of incremental finite rotations, (ii) sequences of accumulating successive concatenations of finite rotations, and (iii) continuous rotations in terms of fully transient quaternions. The incremental and the accumulating approaches provide complementary views. While the relative Euler pole appears to migrate in the latter, it appears fixed in the former. Path, mean, and instantaneous velocity of the migrating Euler pole are derived as well as the angular and trajectoral velocity of the rotational motion about it. The approaches are illustrated by a geological example with actual data and a numerical yet geologically inspired example with artificial data. The former revisits the three‐plate scenario with stationary axes of two “absolute” rotations implying transient “relative” rotations about a migrating Euler pole and employs a proper plate‐circuit argument to determine them numerically without resorting to approximations. The latter applies an involved interplay of incremental and accumulating modeling inducing split–join cycles to approximate sinusoidal trajectories as reported to record plates' motion during the Gondwana breakup.},

Classical models used the first-order strike of this zone as an indicator for perpendicular plate convergence, i.e. NW–SE. We present structural data from both sides of the suture, focusing on fold–cleavage relationships. The statistical analysis reveals an orientation maximum of the youngest cleavage that deviates from the strike of the fold-and-thrust belt by c. 22°. The presence of clockwise transection of the folds by the cleavage (up to − 16°) indicates pervasive sinistral transpression. Three types of fold–cleavage relationships are observed: NE trending folds (I) with or (II) without a transecting cleavage, and (III) non-transected ENE trending folds. We explain the occurrence of different fold–cleavage types by strain partitioning due to NNW convergence obliquely to pre-existent NE trending mechanical anisotropies. In terms of plate tectonics we propose that the classical boundary of the Rheno-Hercynian and the Saxo-Thuringian Zone represents an initial transform plate boundary that was finally affected by sinistral transpression.},

  abstract  = {We present a statistical approach to data mining and quantitatively evaluating detrital age spectra for sedimentary provenance analyses and palaeogeographic reconstructions. Multidimensional scaling coupled with density-based clustering allows the objective identification of provenance end-member populations and sedimentary mixing processes for a composite crust. We compiled 58 601 detrital zircon U–Pb ages from 770 Precambrian to Lower Palaeozoic shelf sedimentary rocks from 160 publications and applied statistical provenance analysis for the Peri-Gondwanan crust north of Africa and the adjacent areas. We have filtered the dataset to reduce the age spectra to the provenance signal, and compared the signal with age patterns of potential source regions. In terms of provenance, our results reveal three distinct areas, namely the Avalonian, West African and East African–Arabian zircon provinces. Except for the Rheic Ocean separating the Avalonian Zircon Province from Gondwana, the statistical analysis provides no evidence for the existence of additional oceanic lithosphere. This implies a vast and contiguous Peri-Gondwanan shelf south of the Rheic Ocean that is supplied by two contrasting super-fan systems, reflected in the zircon provinces of West Africa and East Africa–Arabia.},

  abstract = {The Logan fault is one of many dextral faults that strike generally parallel to the NW-trend of the Northern Canadian Cordillera. Though widely documented, the timing and magnitude of displacement on many of these orogen-parallel faults are not well-constrained. Here, we present new low-temperature thermochronology data and thermal history models from the Upper Hyland River Valley area in the Logan Mountains in southeastern Yukon that document accelerated cooling between ca. 60–50 Ma in localized regions adjacent to faults that strike obliquely to and likely connect with the Logan fault. We propose that this phase of localized cooling was driven by the activation of a network of faults in the Upper Hyland River Valley, resulting in $\sim$4–5.5 km of local exhumation. We suggest that faulting in the Upper Hyland River Valley was synthetic with dextral slip on the Tintina fault, a lithospheric-scale structure thought to have accommodated $\sim$430 km of dextral strike-slip.},
