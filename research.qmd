## Analyzing stress and strain fields

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
The spherical shape of the Earth curves straight orientations on the Earth's surface. Thus, a statistical analysis of large tectonic fields, such as stress and strain, is challenging as long as there is no reference system. In this project, we analyse these fields with respect to the first-order source, plate boundary forces.

Since these forces are at an angular relationship to the plate motion between two plate, the pole of rotation serves as an new reference system. Plate motion parameters are easy to determine and the new reference system also allows for testing and predicting stress fields. This is in particular useful in areas where stress and strain data are not available. And the method can be applied for paleo-stress fields, too.

My work in usable statistical tools for stress/strain orientations is nascent, but follows from my existing work in improving statistical communication in the fields of structural geology and plate motion reconstruction.

## Plate motion

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
Every motion on the earth surface can be described as a rotation around an axis piercing through the Earth's center. Thus, also plate motion is mathematically described as the rotation of spherical polygons around rotational axes (so called Euler poles or Poles of Rotation). But how do we describe plate motion if these pole migrates as well?

In this interdisciplinary project, we use the quaternion formulation of rotations to see what happens to the three axes in a three plate scenario when we change our reference system (usually one plate). We show that in such a scenario, two rotational axis can stay fixed while the third one is constantly changing its location and rotation speed. Thus, a change of plate motion is not only a consequence of (complicated) geodynamic changes - it can be due to a (much easier) cause: spherical geometry. This does not only challenge our way of reconstructing past and current plate motion, it does also has physical consequences on the deformation of plates.

## Reconstructing plate motion: From Pannotia to Pangea

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
The supercontinent cycle is a fundamental concept in geology that describes the periodic assembly and breakup of supercontinents over hundreds of millions of years. By unraveling the break-up history of Pannotia an the assemblage of Pangea, we can gain insights into the mechanisms that drive this cycle, the timescales involved, and the consequences for Earth's systems.

Using various methods, including paleomagnetic data, geochronology, and plate kinematic modeling, we can reconstruct the past positions and movements of continents. This research serves as a test of existing plate tectonic models and helps to refine our understanding of how plates interact over time. 
By identifying inconsistencies and discrepancies in these models, such as the conflicting views on Gondwana-Laurussia interaction during the Devonian, we can develop more accurate and comprehensive representations of Earth's tectonic history. 

Paleozoic orogenies, such as Caledonian, Taconic, Famatinian, Acadian, and Variscan orogenies occurred at different locations and different time. But they do not represent isolated tectonic events - instead they are all related through the Paleozoic motion between Laussia and Gondwana culminating in the assemblage of Pangea. Thus, plate tectonic models and reconstructions must be in agreement with the conclusions we draw from studying these ancient orogens.


In this project, we examine Paleozoic plate tectonics, focusing on the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea. We utilize a novel method to reconstruct relative plate movements from continental deformation patterns, specifically analyzing the interactions between Gondwana and Laurussia. Our research integrates various geological data, including paleogeographic, paleobiogeographic, and geochemical information to explain the complex tectonic evolution of western Pangaea and the Central European Variscides.
